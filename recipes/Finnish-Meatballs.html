    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 cup plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, minced</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>½ cup whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>½ cup whipping cream</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the ground beef, bread crumbs, onion, egg, cream, salt, and allspice in a bowl with your hands until evenly mixed. Roll the mixture into golf ball-sized spheres. </li>
      <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook about half the meatballs in the melted butter until evenly browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes; remove to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs, keeping the liquid in the skillet when finished. </li>
      <li>Sift the flour into the skillet drippings; cook the flour in the skillet drippings until brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Slowly stream the milk into the skillet while whisking vigorously; pour the cream into the mixture and stir until smooth. If you aren't good at making gravy and end up with some lumps you can pour the gravy through a strainer. Return all the meatballs to the skillet; stir to coat with the gravy. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook until the meatballs are cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
