    <p>Some Saucy Balls</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 large onion, grated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger </li>
      <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>3 pounds 85% lean ground beef</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Gravy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
      <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 dash cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1 dash white pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a jelly roll pan. </li>
      <li>Combine bread crumbs, milk, eggs, onion, ginger, salt, nutmeg, garlic, and black pepper in a mixing bowl. Let stand until bread crumbs absorb milk, about 5 minutes. Stir until just mixed and add ground beef. Mix until well blended. Shape mixture into 1-inch meatballs and place on the prepared pan. </li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned, about 18 minutes. Set meatballs aside. </li>
      <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion until tender, about 3 minutes. Stir in flour and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Slowly add broth; cook and stir gravy until smooth and thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Blend in cream, cayenne pepper, and black pepper. </li>
      <li>Gently stir cooked meatballs into gravy and heat through, but do not boil, about 5 minutes more. </li>
    </ol>
